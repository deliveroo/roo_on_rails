        # Update the unscoped metrics given in metric_names.
        # metric_names may be either a single name, or an array of names.
        #
        # This is an internal method, subject to change at any time. Client apps
        # and gems should use the public API (NewRelic::Agent.record_metric)
        # instead.
        #
        # There are four ways to use this method:
        #
        # 1. With a numeric value, it will update the Stats objects associated
        #    with the given metrics by calling record_data_point(value, aux).
        #    aux will be treated in this case as the exclusive time associated
        #    with the call being recorded.
        #
        # 2. With a value of :apdex_s, :apdex_t, or :apdex_f, it will treat the
        #    associated stats as an Apdex metric, updating it to reflect the
        #    occurrence of a transaction falling into the given category.
        #    The aux value in this case should be the apdex threshold used in
        #    bucketing the request.
        #
        # 3. If a block is given, value and aux will be ignored, and instead the
        #    Stats object associated with each named unscoped metric will be
        #    yielded to the block for customized update logic.
        #
        # 4. If value is a Stats instance, it will be merged into the Stats
        #    associated with each named unscoped metric.
        #
        # If this method is called during a transaction, the metrics will be
        # attached to the Transaction, and not merged into the global set until
        # the end of the transaction.
        #
        # Otherwise, the metrics will be recorded directly into the global set
        # of metrics, under a lock.
