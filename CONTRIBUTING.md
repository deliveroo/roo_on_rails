# Contributing

PRs are welcome to this repo to add new features that will be useful across our Ruby services.

If you're putting a PR together, please ensure that:

- There are ample **tests** for your code (they'll be executed against all our supported versions automatically)
- You've made changes to the **`README.md`** file explaining how to make use of the work you're adding
- You've added a line to the **`CHANGELOG.md`** file, with a short explanation of what you've added (feel free to add this in a commit after you've created your PR so you can add the PR number)

Thanks!
